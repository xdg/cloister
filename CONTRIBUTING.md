# Contributing to Cloister

Cloister is not accepting pull requests from external contributors and such pull requests will be automatically closed.

It's ironic that a project devoted to AI coding agents is taking such a step, but here we are. This is a side project and I don't want to make a promise for timely code review that I can't keep.

## Issues Welcome

Well-thought-out issues are welcome, particularly if they include:
- A [Short, Self Contained, Correct, Example](https://sscce.org/) to reproduce the problem
- An LLM prompt that would help diagnose or fix the issue

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/xdg/cloister/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.
